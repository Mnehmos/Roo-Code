This directory will contain unit tests for the parallel execution components.

## Test Files (to be created in Phase 4)

- `ParallelInstanceManager.test.ts` - Worker spawning and lifecycle
- `IPCChannel.test.ts` - Message routing and communication
- `OrchestrationScheduler.test.ts` - Dependency graph and scheduling
- `WorkspaceAnalyzer.test.ts` - Conflict detection and validation
- `ReviewCoordinator.test.ts` - Async review workflow

## Coverage Target

All tests must achieve 80%+ code coverage following Roo Code standards.
